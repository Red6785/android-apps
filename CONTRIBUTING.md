# Contribution Guidelines

You can contribute via pull requests or issues. Pull request saves me time if you know how but it's not much effort for me either way. Corrections are welcome. Feel free to submit an app but please check if there's an existing issues (including closed ones). Majority of apps are not high quality and will not be accepted. I will give a reason why. I will not make generic quality policies for apps to check off as that doesn't work well in practice. If you make a pull request, please follow the format of alphabetical.
