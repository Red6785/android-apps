# Introduction

List of high quality Android apps which respect user privacy and autonomy. For the GrapheneOS community. See [contributing page](CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute.

🟩 = open core source
🟨 = open core (proprietary dependencies but core app is open source)
🟥 = proprietary/closed source
I count source available apps as closed source. They don't help user freedom as legitimate forks aren't allowed. You should also be aware that GPL causes more harm than good in today's world, but that's for another time.
🌙 = Accrescent link
🅿 = Play Store link
🅶 = GitHub link
