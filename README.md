# Introduction

List of high quality Android apps which respect user privacy and autonomy. For the GrapheneOS community. See [contributing page](CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute.

So people don't get upset, I'll mark open source apps with a 游릴, open core apps with a 游릳 and closed source apps with a 游린. I count source available apps as closed source. They don't help user freedom as legitimate forks aren't allowed. You should also be aware that GPL causes more harm than good in today's world, but that's for another time.
